# Tips & Best Practices for Strong Passwords

## ✅ What We Learned
1. **Length matters**: Aim for 16+ characters to defy brute-force.
2. Mix **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols**.
3. Avoid **dictionary words**, patterns, repeat characters.
4. Create **passphrases** with random words and characters.
5. Use **unique passwords** for each account.
6. Consider a **password manager** for storage.

## 🔍 Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force**: Tries all combos—slowed by longer, complex passwords.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses word lists—avoid dictionary words.
- **Rainbow Tables**: Precomputed hashes—unique salts help.
- **Credential Stuffing**: Reuse-hack—prevents reuse across sites.

## 🔐 Summary
Increasing complexity (length + variety) exponentially raises the time and cost to crack a password. Combining length with unpredictability is your strongest defense.
